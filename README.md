# MineclonePY
A project from [Jatc251](https://jatc251.com), forked from [fogleman](https://github.com/fogleman/)'s [python clone of Minecraft](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft/)

This Minecraft clone was written in Python, using a single library to be able to get these functions:
- place blocks
- "mine" blocks
- select different blocks
- change texture pack.

## Dependencies
MineclonePY is able to function using only `pyglet` (version <2.0).

## Controls
- Use left click to destroy block you're looking at
- Use right click to place block on top of face you're looking at
- Use numbers at top of keyboard to change block (numpad does not work currently)
- Use TAB to enable flight
- Values configurable via console at game start
- A few values such as FOV can be changed in game by pressing R
